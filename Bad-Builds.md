## v0.10.0
* The colorScheme of ButtonTheme and minWidth of MaterialButton are not properly handled. See [#22789](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/22789), [flutter/flutter#22880](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/22880), and [flutter/flutter#22919](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/22919)

* Android Gallery gradle build fails on tagged commits without the `-pre.x` suffix. [#14912](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14912)

## v0.1.1 - v0.1.2

* Contain Dart SDK version `2.0.0-dev.23.0`, which suffers from [dart-lang/sdk#32172](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/32172) and manifests to the user as [#14696](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14696).
* Suffer from [#14751](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14751).  They don't yet contain the change that unified the engine Dart SDK and the flutter tool Dart SDK, but these releases are prone to a different manifestation of the same problem with pub's version resolver checking the flutter tool's Dart SDK version and then running code against the engine Dart SDK version. 

## v0.0.22

* Anecdotally, we've seen people complain more when using v0.0.22 than v0.0.21.
