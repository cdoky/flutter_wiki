This wiki is primarily aimed at engineers building or making contributions to Flutter.

If you are new to Flutter, then you will find more general information on the Flutter project, including tutorials and samples, on our Web site at [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev). For specific information about Flutter's APIs, consider our API reference which can be found at the [api.flutter.dev](https://api.flutter.dev/).

If you want to know what we're likely to do in the future, our [[roadmap]] may be of interest.

If you intend to contribute to Flutter, welcome! You are encouraged to start with [our contributor guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), which helps onboard new team members. It points to the most relevant pages on this wiki. You are also invited to join our [Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat) server.
