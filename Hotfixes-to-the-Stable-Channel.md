In general, our philosophy is to update the `stable` channel on a quarterly basis with feature updates. In the intervening period, occasionally we may decide a bug or regression warrants a hotfix. We tend to be extremely conservative with these hotfixes, since there's always a risk that fixing one bug introduces a new one, and we want the `stable` channel to always represent our most tested builds. 

We intend to announce hotfixes to the [flutter-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce) group, and we recommend that you subscribe to that list if you publish an application using Flutter. 

Note that we only hotfix the latest version -- if you see bugs on older versions of the `stable` channel, please consider moving to the latest `stable` channel version. 

To ensure that you have the latest stable version with the hotfixes listed below, use the flutter tool at the command line as follows:

```
$ flutter channel stable
$ flutter upgrade
```
