Any PR that changes a package's version (which should be most PRs) should be published
to pub.dev.

## Automatic release

The packages in flutter/plugins and flutter/packages are automatically released with a Github Action workflow named [“release”](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml). If a commit on master branch contains version updates to one ore more packages, the “release” CI will publish the new versions to pub.dev and push the release tag to GitHub. The “release” CI passes if
1. the release process is successful, or
2. there are no version updates in the commit, or
3. the new versions have already been published.  

If you are a Flutter team member at Google and you need access to the publisher account, please see b/191674407.

The “release” CI only runs on post-submit, and waits until all the other CI jobs have passed before starting. Like any other CI job, The “release” CI blocks future PRs if failed. 

_Note: the “release” CI does not automatically publish the `flutter_plugin_tools` package._

### New packages

When a new package is released for the first time, it will be owned by the publisher account rather than the flutter.dev verified publisher. Someone with access (see above) needs to log into pub.dev with the publisher account and transfer the package to the verified publisher using the package's Admin tab.

### What if the “release” CI failed?

If it is a flake (for example, network issue), a Flutter team member can simply run the CI again. For more complicated cases, a Flutter team member can also manually release the packages, then re-run the CI to pass.

The most common source of failure of the `release` task is that another test failed; if that is due to flake, you will need to first re-run the failing test task, then once it's green re-run `release`.

## Manual release [Deprecated]

The Flutter team member most involved with the PR should be the person responsible
for publishing. In cases where the PR is authored by a Flutter team member, the
publisher should probably be the author. In other cases, the reviewing Flutter team
member should publish.

Some things to keep in mind before publishing the release:

- Is the post-submit CI for that commit green? Even if CI shows as green on
  the PR it's still possible for it to fail on merge (e.g., due to a
  conflict with another recent change). Always check the post-submit CI
  before publishing.
- [Publishing is
  forever.](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/publishing#publishing-is-forever)
  Hopefully any bugs or breaking in changes in this PR have already been caught
  in PR review, but now's a second chance to revert before anything goes live.
- "Don't deploy on a Friday." Consider carefully whether or not it's worth
  immediately publishing an update before a stretch of time where you're going
  to be unavailable. There may be bugs with the release or questions about it
  from people that immediately adopt it, and uncovering and resolving those
  support issues will take more time if you're unavailable.

To release a package:
1. `git checkout <commit_hash_to_publish>`. This should be the commit of the
  PR you are publishing unless there's a very specific reason you are using
  a different version.
1. Ensure that `git status` is clean, and that there are no extra files in
  your local repository (e.g., via `git clean -xfd`).
1. Use the [`publish-plugin` command from
  `flutter_plugin_tools`](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/script/tool/README.md).
  This command checks that you've done the step above, publishes the new version to pub.dev,
  and tags the commit in the format of `<package_name>-v<package_version>` then pushes
  it to the upstream repository.

### Fully manual backup option

If for some reason you can't use `flutter_plugin_tools` in step 3, you can publish manually:
  1. Push the package update to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) using `dart pub publish`.
  2. Tag the commit with `git tag` in the format of `<package_name>-v<package_version>`
  3. Push the tag to the upstream master branch with `git push upstream <tagname>`.
