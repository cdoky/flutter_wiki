_If you've already built the engine and have the configuration set up but merely need a refresher on
actually compiling the code, see [[Compiling the engine]]._

Make sure you have the following dependencies available:

 * Linux, macOS, or Windows.
     * Linux supports cross-compiling artifacts for Android and Fuchsia, but not iOS.
     * macOS supports cross-compiling artifacts for Android and iOS.
     * Windows doesn't support cross-compiling artifacts for any of Android, Fuchsia, or iOS.
 * git (used for source version control).
 * An IDE. See also the section at the bottom of this page for advice on setting up syntax highlighting while editing the engine.
 * An ssh client (used to authenticate with GitHub).
 * **Chromium's
   [depot_tools](http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up)
   (make sure it's in your path). We use the `gclient` tool from depot_tools.**
 * Python (used by many of our tools, including `gclient`).
 * On macOS and Linux: curl and unzip (used by `gclient sync`).
 * On Windows:
   - Visual Studio 2017 or later (required for non-Googlers only).
   - Windows 10 SDK (required for non-Googlers only).
     - Be sure to install the "Debugging Tools for Windows" feature.
 * On macOS: the latest Xcode.
 * Recommended for Googlers: Goma for distributed builds. The [compiling page](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Compiling-the-engine) has more information on how to set this up.

You do not need [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/linux.html) installed,
as a Dart tool chain is automatically downloaded as part of the "getting the code"
step. Similarly for the Android SDK, it's downloaded by the `gclient sync` step below.

Run the following steps to set up your environment:

1. Fork `https://github.com/flutter/engine` into your own GitHub account. If
   you already have a fork, and are now installing a development environment on
   a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork so that you don't use stale
   configuration options from long ago. Do not clone this repo locally, scripts
   will take care of that for you.
1. If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to github then
   follow the directions here: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/.
1. Create an empty directory called `engine` for your copy of the repository and
   `cd` into it. (It is possible to use a different name, but some tools assume this
   name unless configured otherwise, so calling it `engine` will make thing easier.)
1. Create a `.gclient` file in the `engine` directory with the
   following contents, replacing `<your_name_here>` with your GitHub
   account name:
   ```python
   solutions = [
     {
       "managed": False,
       "name": "src/flutter",
       "url": "git@github.com:<your_name_here>/engine.git",
       "custom_deps": {},
       "deps_file": "DEPS",
       "safesync_url": "",
     },
   ]
   ```
1. `gclient sync` in that directory. This will fetch all the source code
   that Flutter depends on. Avoid interrupting this script, as doing so
   can leave your
   repository in an inconsistent state that is tedious to clean up.
   (This step automatically runs `git clone`, among other things.)
1. Add a remote for the upstream repository:
   - `cd src/flutter` (This was created in your `engine` directory
   by `gclient sync`.)
   - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:flutter/engine.git` (So
   that you fetch from the master `flutter/engine` repository, not
   your clone, when running `git fetch` et al.)
   - `cd ..` (Return to the `src` directory that `gclient sync` created
   in your `engine` directory.)
1. If you're on Linux, the following may or may not help you install
   required dependencies. **Note:** These scripts are
    distro- and version-specific, so are not guaranteed to work on
    any configuration. If they fail, you may need to find comparable
    packages to the ones that weren't found. You are free to update
    them if you wish for your distribution, but it is often easier to
    just install the packages you need as you go, particularly for the
    `install-build-deps.sh` script.
    - `sudo ./build/install-build-deps-android.sh`
    - `sudo ./build/install-build-deps.sh`
    - `sudo ./flutter/build/install-build-deps-linux-desktop.sh`
1. If you're on Mac:
    - install Oracle's Java JDK, version 1.8 or later
1. If you're planning on working on the
    [buildroot](https://github.com/flutter/buildroot) repository as
    well, and have a local checkout of that repository, run the
    following commands in the `src` directory to update your git
    remotes accordingly:
    ```bash
    git remote rename origin upstream
    git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_name_here>/buildroot.git
    ```

## Editor autocomplete support

### Xcode [Objective-C++]

On Mac, you can simply use Xcode (e.g., `open out/host_debug_unopt/products.xcodeproj`).

### VSCode with C/C++ Intellisense [C/C++]

VSCode can provide some IDE features using the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools). It will provide basic support on install without needing any additional configuration. There will probably be some issues, like header not found errors and incorrect jump to definitions.

Intellisense can also use our `compile_commands.json` for more robust functionality. Either symlink `src/out/compile_commands.json` to the project root at `src` or provide an absolute path to it in the `c_cpp_properties.json` config file. See ["compile commands" in the c_cpp_properties.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference). This will likely resolve the basic issues mentioned above.

For adding IDE support to the Java code in the engine with VSCode, see ["Using VSCode as an IDE for the Android Embedding"](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment#using-vscode-as-an-ide-for-the-android-embedding).

### cquery/ccls (multiple editors) [C/C++/Objective-C++]

Alternatively, [cquery](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery) and a derivative [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) are highly scalable C/C++/Objective-C language server that supports IDE features like go-to-definition, call hierarchy, autocomplete, find reference etc that works reasonably well with our engine repo. 

They(https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Editor-configuration) [supports](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/wiki/Editor-Configuration) editors like VSCode, emacs, vim etc. 

To set up:
1. Install cquery
    1. `brew install cquery` or `brew install ccls` on osx; or
    1. [Build from source](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Getting-started)
1. Generate compile_commands.json which our GN tool already does such as via `src/flutter/tools/gn --ios --unoptimized` 
1. Install an editor extension such as [VSCode-cquery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cquery-project.cquery) or [vscode-ccls](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ccls-project.ccls)
    1. VSCode-query and vscode-ccls requires the compile_commands.json to be at the project root. Copy or symlink `src/out/compile_commands.json` to `src/` or `src/flutter` depending on which folder you want to open.
    1. Follow [Setting up the extension](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code#setting-up-the-extension) to configure VSCode-query.

### Using VSCode as an IDE for the Android Embedding [Java]

1. Install the extensions vscjava.vscode-java-pack and vscjava.vscode-java-dependency. 

1. Right click on the `shell/platform/android` folder in the engine source and click on `Add Folder to Java Source Path`. This creates an anonymous workspace and turns those files from ["syntax mode"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-project#_syntax-mode) to "compile mode". At this point, you should see a lot of errors since none of the external imports are found. 

1. Find the "Java Dependencies" pane in your Explorer view. Use the "Explorer: Focus on Java Dependencies View" command if hidden. 

1. Refresh the view and find the "flutter_*" project. There should be a "_/shell/platform/android" source folder there. 

1. In the "Referenced Libraries" sibling node, click the + button, navigate to `engine/src/third_party/android_embedding_dependencies` and add the entire folder. This is the equivalent of adding 
    ```
    "java.project.referencedLibraries": [
      "{path to engine}/src/third_party/android_embedding_dependencies/lib/**/*.jar"
    ]
    ```
    to your VSCode's settings.json for your user or for your workspace.

1. If you previously had a `shell/platform/android/.classpath`, delete it. 

## VSCode Additional Useful Configuration

1. Create [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) for header files with [this configuration](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/tools/vscode/settings.json5). This will let you use `hdr` keyboard macro to create the boiler plate header code. Also consider some of [these settings](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/tools/vscode/settings.json5) and [more tips](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+show/lkgr/docs/vscode.md).

2. To format GN files on save, [consider using this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=persidskiy.vscode-gnformat).
