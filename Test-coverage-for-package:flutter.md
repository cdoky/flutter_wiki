## How to view test coverage

The easiest way to see our overall test coverage should be using the [Flutter page on Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/flutter/flutter?branch=master). The graph at the top is supposed to be updated with green commit to the master branch. Unfortunately Coveralls has been broken for Flutter for a long time and no progress has been made to resolve [the issue](https://github.com/lemurheavy/coveralls-public/issues/1103).

When you run `flutter update-packages`, we download the latest coverage data for `package:flutter` to `packages/flutter/coverage/lcov.info`.  This data isn't synchronized in any way with the revision of `flutter.git` you're using, so there's a bit of a race condition between when you update your checkout of `flutter.git` and when you download the coverage file.  Most of the time, a little version skew isn't too harmful, but it's valuable to be aware that it might exist. (Well, right now the skew is many years because of https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/81803, unfortunately.)

IDEs typically have ways to show this information. For example, here is how to show it in Atom:

1. Install the [lcov-info](https://atom.io/packages/lcov-info) package.  This package has a few quirks to its UI, but it generally seems to work.

2. Open `packages/flutter` in Atom.  The lcov-info plugin only seems to work if you open `packages/flutter` directly (as opposed to opening one of its parent directories).

3. Open a `dart` file in the `lib/src` directory.  For some reason, you need to have a Dart file open in order to activate the lcov-info plugin.

4. Activate the lcov-info package using the `Packages > Lcov Info > Toggle` menu command.

5. At this point, you should see green and red highlighted lines in `dart` files (hopefully more green than red) as well as a scrollable list of the coverage percentages for each file in `package:flutter`.  The green lines mean this line was executed in a test.  The red line means that this line is a candidate for execution but was not executed in a test. Lines that are highlighted are not considered candidates for execution. Some of the non-highlighted lines are a bit surprising (e.g., return statements or constant declarations), but they appear to be correct.

If you use Emacs, you can use the `coverlay` package. Use `coverlay-load-file` to specify the `.../packages/flutter/coverage/lcov.info` file, configure `coverlay:base-path` to point to the `.../packages/flutter`, and configure other aspects of the `coverlay` package as you desire.

## How to see new test coverage quickly

If you're using a Linux machine, you can see the updated coverage after adding a test quickly using the `--merge-coverage` option to `flutter test`. For example, suppose you added a test case to `test/material/dialog_test.dart`. You can run `flutter test --merge-coverage test/material/dialog_test.dart` to run just that one test and merge the coverage data into your view. In Atom, to get lcov-info to see the new data, sometimes you need to change tabs. In Emacs, to see new data, press `C-c C-l g`.

Merging coverage works by combining the `packages/flutter/coverage/lcov.base.info` coverage data, which `flutter update-packages` downloaded from the cloud, with the coverage data from that one test run.  The combined data is written back into `packages/flutter/coverage/lcov.info`, where it is picked up by the lcov-info plugin.

Each time you run `--merge-coverage`, the tool goes back to the original `lcov.base.info` data before adding the current run.  If you want to see the change in coverage when changing more than one test file, you'll need to pass all the test file names explicitly on the command line.

## How compute test coverage slowly

If you want to recompute coverage data from scratch, you can use the `--coverage` flag.  For example, `cd packages/flutter && flutter test --coverage`.  It's pretty rare that you'll need to recompute coverage from scratch.  This command is mostly used by the bots to generate the coverage report for Coveralls.
